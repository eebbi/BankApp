# BankApp

This BankApp is a simple application that works like a bank. The user will use the number buttons on the right side to choose the 
amount of money to use and either deposit or withdraw that amount with the buttons.


The application is done in Java and Swing, also with the help of WindowBuilder to make a working UI.

Installation

Usage
---
When the user first starts the application, there is a textfield to input your name in, and a "Login" button below that. 
The input on the "your name" textfield does not matter.

After typing in your name and logging in, the bank app will open and the user can use the features that are provided.
